# Deathtrap Dungeon
#-------------------------------------
The player must venture through a dungeon filled with traps, danger and death!

Design:
 Player starts in the "Trial of Champions" map.
 Here they can enter the dungeon, or interact with the Enchantress or Blacksmith.
 
 Upon death, the player is sent to the "Jail", where they need to select their successor.
 Upon death, move the soulstain to the "Trial of Champions" from any of the dungeon maps.
 
Successors:
  Similar to Rogue Legacy, upon death the player can choose from 3 'classes' with one trait each, upon selecting they will be teleported back into the open area.

Treasure:
 Semi-random, treasure locations will be randomised, and the loot itself will be distributed via a 'bucket' method within EMEVD on pickup
 
Dungeons:
 Each level will have 3 sets of enemies: Default, Alt 1 and Alt 2. Which are used will be randomised each time.
