# Deathtrap Dungeon
#-------------------------------------
The player must venture through a dungeon filled with traps, danger and death!

Design:
 Dungeon size should be approximately 15 minutes of running (with no breaks).
 This means playtime will be 1 to 2 hours, factoring in combat and other gameplay.
 
 Tombsward Base: 35 secs for full run

Progression:
 The player starts with a Dagger at the inner entrance of the dungeon.
 The goal is to venture through the dungeon and reach the exit stairs to the outside once more.

 Two game-modes (this will replace class selection):
  Softcore: death will reset player back to the start of the dungeon.
  Hardcore: death will reset player back to the start of the dungeon and override their Chr to reset their equipment.

Treasure:
 Semi-random, treasure locations will be randomised, and the loot itself will be distributed via a 'bucket' method within EMEVD on pickup
 
Equipment:
